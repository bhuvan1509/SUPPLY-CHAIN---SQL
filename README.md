The process of supply chain analysis involves executing SQL queries to gain insights. It starts with basic queries to understand product pricing, sales, and inventory levels. Intermediate queries then explore lead times, shipping costs, and transportation modes. Advanced queries delve into customer demographics, revenue generation, manufacturing efficiency, and quality control. By systematically applying these queries, you can optimize various aspects of the supply chain for better performance and cost efficiency.



**Overall Insights:**
**Inventory Management:** The queries provide a clear picture of stock levels, helping in efficient inventory management.

**Cost Optimization**: Identifies cost-effective shipping carriers and manufacturing cost optimization opportunities.

**Customer Analysis:** Provides detailed insights into customer demographics and their impact on revenue.

**Efficiency:** Helps in identifying production bottlenecks and improving manufacturing efficiency.

**Quality Control:** Analyzes defect rates and inspection results, aiding in maintaining high product quality.

These insights and analyses are crucial for making data-driven decisions and optimizing various aspects of the supply chain.
